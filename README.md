Hello!

This is my Module 3 Python Challenge

PyBank Instructions:

    "In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "date" and "profit/losses".

    Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values: 
     - The total number of months included in the dataset
     - The net total amoint of Profit/Losses over the entire period
     - The changes in Profit/Losses ofver the entire period, and then the average of those changes
     - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
     - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results."


PyPoll Instructions:

    "In This Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. 

    You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
     -The total number of votes cast
     -A complete list of candidates who received votes
     -The percentage of votes each candidate won
     -The winner of the election based on popular vote

    In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results."



This challenge was definitely pretty difficult and took a lot of time, but I feel like I learned a ton while trying to figure it out. 

The most challenging part for me was definitely pypoll and forming the for loop to list the candidates and their votes. The way I did it seems to work, so hopefully thats what you were looking for. 

Thanks for your time!
